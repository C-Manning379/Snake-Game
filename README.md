# Snake-Game

Intro
-----

I have developed a Snake game in Python which has a main menu, a score counter and an interactive background.

Requirements
-----------

To run this script you must ensure that you have the following libraries
pygame
time
random
sys
Time, random and sys should be pre installing with the Python libraries but to install pygame, you would do a pip install pygame

How to use
----------

You run the game and use the arrows keys to move the snake to the snacks, allowing it to grow. If you lose, press y to try again or n to quit

Further Improvements
--------------------

I plan to add a high score menu, as well as make the snake and it's snacks look much more graphically appealing
